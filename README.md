# Flare: AI Agents That Pay for Intelligence on Stellar

> **176 real Stellar transactions. 8 intelligence categories. Hybrid X402 + MPP payment channels. Zero subscriptions.**

### What We Built

Flare is a mobile app where AI agents monitor flights, crypto, stocks, news, products, jobs, real estate, and events, paying for every data query with real USDC micropayments on Stellar. Agents verify findings with double-checks, cross-verify with other agents, and only alert you when something actually matters. You wake up to a morning briefing that cost $0.03.

### Note
Note 1: Flare mobile application is not live on Play store or Appstore yet, but for testing purpose, you can download and test on an android device only, you can download the application here: https://we.tl/t-UGiEx8pkPp2LwQ4t

Note 2: Because you did not download the application from playstore or Appstore, you might have android restriction message on your device due to download from unknown sources which your android device was configured to not accept. If you have any issues installing the application on your device, it means your android software is rejecting it because it wasn't downloaded from playstore, please you would have to use the video above as a proof of work done until i upload the application to playstore after moving to mainnet. But if it installs successfully on your device, you can proceed to test, everything is on testnet.

## How Flare's Payment System Works

Flare runs a hybrid payment architecture. It combines two Stellar payment protocols to optimize for both cost and speed.

### X402 Flow (for low-frequency watchers such as flights, real estate, jobs)

When a watcher checks infrequently (every 6 hours or more), Flare uses a direct per-check payment. The scheduler triggers a check, the data service returns a 402 Payment Required challenge, Flare signs and submits a Soroban USDC transfer, then sends the transaction hash back to the service. The service verifies the payment on-chain via Soroban RPC and returns the data. This costs one Stellar transaction per query.

### MPP Flow (for high-frequency watchers such as crypto, stocks)

When a watcher checks frequently (more than once every 6 hours), Flare opens an MPP payment channel. This involves deploying a one-way-channel Soroban contract, depositing USDC into it, and then executing all subsequent checks off-chain using Ed25519 signed cumulative commitments. The data service verifies each proof locally without touching the blockchain. When the session ends or the budget runs low, the channel closes with a single on-chain transaction that settles the total amount owed. This means two Stellar transactions total (open and close), regardless of how many checks were executed in between.

**Security & Anti-Cheat Channel Settlement:**
To resolve the vulnerability where a user could rapidly stream off-chain data and delete the watcher before the payment channel hits its expiry/settles, we’ve directly hooked into the `DELETE /api/watchers/:id` route in `backend/src/routes/watchers.ts`. Now, immediately before deleting a watcher from the database, the server will intentionally look for an active, off-chain state. If found, it immediately forces the smart contract to settle and finalize the payment for all the data used up until the millisecond the watcher was deleted. The funds are legally extracted to the operator wallet, ensuring complete transactional security.

### How the Router Decides

The payment router automatically selects the right protocol based on the watcher's check interval. If the interval is 6 hours or more, it uses X402. If the interval is under 6 hours, it opens an MPP channel. Users never need to know or care about the underlying payment rail.

### Multi-Stage Verification

When a finding is detected, Flare does not simply alert the user. It runs a verification pipeline. First, the initial check detects the finding and pays the data service (first Stellar payment). After 60 seconds, a second check re-verifies that the finding still holds (second Stellar payment). Then a different agent is hired to cross-verify from another angle, for example a flight finding triggers a news check for travel advisories (third Stellar payment). Finally, a confidence score from 0 to 100 is calculated based on five factors: data freshness, verification status, historical consistency, cross-check results, and source reliability. Only then is the user notified.

This means up to three Stellar transactions per finding, each one verifiable on-chain.

## The 8 Intelligence Categories

| Category              | What It Monitors                                                 | Cost Per Check |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Flights**           | Airline prices, error fares, historical lows, specific carriers  | 0.008 USDC     |
| **Crypto**            | Coin prices, portfolio value, pair ratios, volume spikes         | 0.005 USDC     |
| **Stocks**            | Stock prices, 52-week records, earnings, insider trades          | 0.004 USDC     |
| **News**              | Keywords, company mentions, sentiment, multi-source verification | 0.005 USDC     |
| **Products**          | Multi-store comparison, price drops, back-in-stock, wishlists    | 0.006 USDC     |
| **Jobs**              | Role matching, company watching, salary trends, hot jobs         | 0.007 USDC     |
| **Real Estate**       | New listings, price reductions, neighborhood trends              | 0.008 USDC     |

## System Architecture

Flare is composed of four layers that work together to deliver autonomous, paid intelligence.

**The Flutter mobile app** is the user-facing layer. It handles watcher creation (including voice input and templates), displays findings with confidence scores, shows the live payment stream visualization, renders the wallet with savings analytics, and delivers push notifications. The app communicates with the backend over HTTPS and connects to the WebSocket server for real-time streaming data.

**The Express backend** runs on Render and manages all server-side logic. It contains the scheduler (which triggers checks at configured intervals), the payment router (which decides between X402 and MPP for each check), the check executor (which calls data services and processes responses), the finding detector (which analyzes data against alert conditions), the verification pipeline (double-check and cross-check), the confidence scorer, the morning briefing generator, and the notification sender. It also manages user wallets, encrypts Stellar secret keys, and tracks budgets per watcher. The backend stores all state in PostgreSQL.

**The data services** are Express endpoints protected by the stellarPaywall middleware. Each service covers one intelligence category (flights, crypto, news, products, jobs, stocks, real estate, sports). The middleware accepts both X402 payments (via the x-stellar-tx header containing a verified transaction hash) and MPP payments (via the x-mpp-proof header containing a signed cumulative commitment). For the hackathon demo, these services return enriched mock data designed to trigger realistic findings. In production, they would connect to real APIs like Skyscanner, CoinGecko, and NewsAPI.

**The Stellar layer** handles all financial operations. For X402, this means individual Soroban USDC transfers verified via RPC. For MPP, this means deploying one-way-channel Soroban contracts, funding them with USDC deposits, signing off-chain Ed25519 commitments for each check, and settling the net amount when the channel closes. All transactions execute on Stellar Testnet using the USDC token contract.

## What's Real vs Simulated

| Feature                  | Status        | Details                                                              |
| :----------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| USDC Payments (X402)     | **REAL**      | Every check equals a real Soroban USDC transfer on Stellar testnet   |
| MPP Payment Channels     | **REAL**      | One-way-channel contract deployed, channels open and close on-chain  |
| MPP Off-Chain Proofs     | **REAL**      | Ed25519 signed cumulative commitments, verified locally              |
| WebSocket Streaming      | **REAL**      | Live data frames with MPP proof exchange                             |
| Wallet Management        | **REAL**      | Keypair generation, funding, trustlines, balance tracking            |
| Budget Enforcement       | **REAL**      | Watchers auto-pause when USDC budget exhausted                       |
| Multi-Agent Verification | **REAL**      | Double-check plus cross-check equals up to 3 Stellar txs per finding |
| Confidence Scoring       | **REAL**      | 5-factor scoring algorithm based on on-chain verification            |
| Push Notifications       | **REAL**      | Firebase Cloud Messaging with deep linking                           |
| Data Sources             | **SIMULATED** | Mock services with realistic data patterns                           |

**Why mock data?** Integrating 8 real-time APIs (Skyscanner, CoinGecko, etc.) would cost thousands in API fees and risk rate-limiting during judging. The mock data engine produces realistic patterns that trigger the finding detection, verification pipeline, and confidence scoring, which is where the real engineering lives. In production, swapping mock handlers for real APIs is a configuration change, not an architecture change.
